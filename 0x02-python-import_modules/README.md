import is a keyword used in other files, the same file below or even the interpreter to get access to function statements and executables in a python script
there are some library imports like:
	this
	math
	statistics
	os
	urllib.request
	random
to use modules we might have to import them from afile to ours
this can be done throuth1
>>> import modname
we can then use
>>> modulename.object
modulename is the name of the file we are to import from after removing the .py extension
object is the function name we are to use
sometimes especiaally in mathematicall , os and internet modules we might have soething that looks like:
>>> modulename.obect(what is to be operated on)
if __name__ == "__main__: makes a code inexectable even when imported, it is also important when testing a piece of code
when importing a defined function , we specify the function name while importing and so it becomes the module name
to use the imported function in a printing, we will call the entire function as a whole allong with its parameters parenthesised	
we use square brackets when dealing with argv i.e argv[]
we use int() to cast strings in python to numbers
