i learnt on major principles in javascript such as objects scopesand closures
ileart on class defnition
i learnt on use of super for constructor ffields
i learnt on use of extends for suclass to baseclass inheritancee

	0-rectangle.js
module.exports is used to creates fuctions hat can be imported or required in other files
	1-rectanle.js
i learnt that constructors parameters are thevalue of fields in the same constructor
just like self in python in javascript we use "this" in constructors o take an instance of the constructor
	2-rectangle.js
programming has shorter was of doing something for example instead of saying <= it is similar we canjust use > symbol if dealing with statements being falsified
self is not present n javascript as a keyword
	3-rectangle.js
"this" is a keyword used to take the value in instantation
field names can be inherited in other methods
for loops can take initialisation with the first term let followed by a word
after that a condition is set followed by a restriction
