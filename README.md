python is a programming language made by Guido Van Rossum
it has many variable types like bullion, characters, integers, strings
to print strings one can use methods such as using the % method, the .format method and the f string method, however the fstring method is the best 
to change how a tring is being used we use the functions capitalize, tranctuate, lower, upper, title after a dot and the function name followed by brackets
to search strings we can use the endswith, startswith, count find and rfind the rfind finds the occurence of the highest  startinmg index in the strng
if not found  the rfind just like in find which returns the lowest index will print out -1
