exceptions are the instances of something wong happening during program execution
there are many types of exceptions egKeyError, ValueError, TypeError,ZeroDivisionError
to handle exceptions one uses the try keyword
/*how the try works*/
1.first of all, all the statements between try and except are tested
2.if no execution occurs, the except clause is not executed and try is already complete
3.....
a class in excpt is compatible if it is the same class or a baseclass thereof
when an exception occurs, it may have instance variables.
the variable is bound to the args attribute that stores the arguenment
