a list is an immutable heterogenious indexable data stracture stored inside square brackets assigned to a variable
LIST OPERATIONS INCLUDE
list.append(val)
list.pop(index) - removes at a certain index
list.insert(index, value) - inserts a value at a certain index
list.clear() - removes all values from a list
list.sorted() - returns a sorted list that can be reversed
list.sort - returns an unchangable list which cannot be reversed
STRINGS
when dealing with strings the following have to be deeply considered:
length of the string found with len()
wheather to use for loops or conditionals to deal with them
types of keywords found in strings but not in lists
LISTS
a mutable datat type with heterogenous indexable values
lists are enclosed in square brackets and even when calling them if a for loop is not passed the value will be stored in brackets
QUESTION0:
i learned that in printing a list if we dont specify that we want the elements only using a for loop we will get the values of the variable in brackets
QUESTION1:
- i learned that the length of a string is len(string) - 1
- i also learnt that indexes can never be negative from the front
- i also lernt that NULL in c is equal to None which means there is nothing
- i also learnt that string[index] gives the value of a string at a particular index
QUESTION 2:
- i learnt that when dealing with strings we should first compare with the if statement to test wheather the list is empty
- i lernt that lists variable[index] = value ;makes the lists at a particular index change its value
QUESTION 3:
