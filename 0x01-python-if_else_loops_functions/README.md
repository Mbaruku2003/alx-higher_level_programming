python has two loops for loop and while loop
the for loop and python has new built ins like a new else statement at the end as well as pass, break and continue
we use range function to determine the starting point , ensing point value and also the conditionals statements to be skipped
match is used as an alternative of switchcase statements in c
functions in python are defined with the def then the function name which is followed by arguenments inside brackets
