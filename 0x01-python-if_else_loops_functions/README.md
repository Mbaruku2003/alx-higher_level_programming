python has two loops for loop and while loop
the for loop and python has new built ins like a new else statement at the end as well as pass, break and continue
we use range function to determine the starting point , ensing point value and also the conditionals statements to be skipped
match is used as an alternative of switchcase statements in c
functions in python are defined with the def then the function name which is followed by arguenments inside brackets
return from a python function will return a value or None if not passed
the in keyword tests wheather a sequence contans a value or not
when using conditionals, know the condition that requires to be put at the else tatement
if we are dealing with if else conditionals and also loops if what you want to do is to be affected by all the conditionals and statements in the code, we should not indent but state the process at the same essence with the first if or for loop
each bit of code is important the most important is the small things
know how o bild small things and how to connect them to build the full visioned result(code)
end="" is used to connect a line to anotherline awaitingto be joined to it
for example in question 1 it is used to join a statment awaiting to be printed with another statement that depends on an if else statemenit
we use comparison operators like != and == during comparisn of variables and values not 'not'
*if we want to print in a new line we should get out of theloop
*end="" may be used to join results of each iteration in a oop
